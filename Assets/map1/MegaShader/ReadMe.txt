Hi and thank you for buying Mega Shader Set.

Here you will find the Mega-Detail shader, better suited to small props (no DX11 tesselation on this one)

There is Also the Mega Shader ground based which uses RGB masking to separate the mixing (uses DX11 tessellation)

and

Mega Water Based Shader which has its own water plane control (all on one plane, uses DX11 tessellation)

All of these shaders are high power demand from your GPU and need to be tested. However with graphics cards now advancing rapidly, this wont be an issue for smaller scenes at first.

Use sparringly.

I reccommend using Post Process stack with deferred rendering to get the best results, add some AO and screen space reflection to make it look nice like the images seen on the asset store.

Many thanks, and please Email me.

Also, I had issues making the Post process stack work in untiy 2017.4 so you may too. I used 2017.1 and it is working again.
